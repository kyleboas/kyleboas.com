PSG's full-backs have a tendency to overextend themselves moving wide, leaving space behind between them and the nearest center-back. Teams should look to play wide and then quickly work the ball behind their full-back.

If Lucas Hern치ndez is going to move wide like this, the ball-side center-back should shift over to attempt to cover up that space.

PSG are aggressive in the wide areas, committing numbers to pressure the ball carrier. When Real Sociedad worked the ball quickly out of that press, there was at least one, if not two, options free to be played into the box. 

You've done the hard part when you trap PSG wide, and they commit numbers to the press. The easy part is playing that pass to the free man.
