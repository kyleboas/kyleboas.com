An email Apple co-founder Steve Jobs sent to himself thirteen months before he passed:

> From: Steve Jobs, sjobs@apple.com
> To: Steve Jobs, sjobs@apple.com
> Date: Thursday, September 2, 2010 at 11:08PM
> 
> I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.
> 
> I do not make any of my own clothing.
> 
> I speak a language I did not invent or refine.
> 
> I did not discover the mathematics I use.
> 
> I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.
> 
> I am moved by music I did not create myself.
> 
> When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive.
> 
> I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.
> 
> I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.
