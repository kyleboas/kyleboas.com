Federico Valverde initiates and perfectly times this run into the box before Jude Bellingham passes to Vinicius Jr. because Real Madrid teaches their players how to recognize patterns within unscripted movement.

This is the benefit of giving the player the freedom to find their own solution. Either through instruction or through experience playing together, Valverde instinctively knows that if Vinicius Jr. receives the ball here, he will drive to the byline.

There is an overload on the ball side; naturally, that means the far side will be unoccupied. The opponent will be drawn to the ball, and Valverde can arrive on their blind side.

A midfielder on another team would not make a near-35-yard run into the box. And it was perfectly timed. 

Valverde showed a high level of intelligence to know where his teammates and the defenders would move, and it showed the strong relationship between Vinicius Jr. and Valverde to immediately find that pass.
