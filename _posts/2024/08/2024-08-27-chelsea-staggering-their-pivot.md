Staggering each line of players makes a huge difference. Chelsea midfielders Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo stagger, and that opens up the pass forward out to the wing, draws a defender in, and creates space for Caicedo once they continue up the wing.

That pass to Enzo Fernandez from Moises Caicedo is possible because he is closer to the passer, the goalkeeper, Robert Sanchez, than Caicedo is. They are staggered. 

That allows Chelsea to play a positive pass forward within three passes. Two Wolves players are drawn towards Enzo and Caicedo central as they attempt to collapse on the ball. That opens space wide.

When Enzo and Caicedo aren't staggered, they can't pass between each other from the goalkeeper. One or the other would have to pass back to a center-back to play out to the wing. 

That also allows the central Wolves players to anticipate the pass to the fullback and winger on the right, creating less space out wide while still remaining compact central.

It is predictable, and there is less space.

</figure>

As the ball is played up the wing, the Wolves defender closest to Caicedo has to plant their feet and pivot their hips to engage the fullback out wide. That gives the fullback more time on the ball before they are forced to make their next pass.

Once the pass is played to the right-winger, Caicedo is then left unmarked behind Chelsea's front line.

Compare that to when they pass up the right wing from a flat pivot that isn't staggered; the space is much smaller. The Wolves defenders don't have to work very hard to stay compact, closing off space centrally. Neither Caicedo nor Enzo can break free into space to offer themselves up for a pass. 

That is the effect of two players staggering; now imagine the entire team moving unpredictably, staggering, and shifting positions to open space. Attacking midfielders switching sides. That is what Chelsea did against Wolves. They were less rigid, and I did not expect them to adapt their play to this so quickly.
