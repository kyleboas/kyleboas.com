Manchester United allow the ball-side center-back to jump out to mark the closest player, but last season this was a problem when the ball was played forward because of the space it created once that center-back retreated. There are two better solutions.

It does not matter who you place in there at center-back; they are all instructed to aggressively position themselves, electing to jump out. One of the best examples of this occurred in [their loss at Crystal Palace](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/05/07/manchester-uniteds-back-four-on-rope/).

</figure>

The problem is that when the ball is played wide to the wing and Bennett retreats back to the defensive line, Casemiro isn't in a position to mark the Liverpool player Bennett demarked from. 

That leaves a large space between Manchester United's back line and their midfield. Because that space is there, the left-back can't go out to challenge the ball.

</figure>

The first alternative approach would be for Bennett to not retreat back and stay with the Liverpool player he marked. That would allow Casemiro to focus on the players on the far side. If you are going to jump out, you might as well go all the way, not half-way. Go all the way or not at all.

That is better than leaving space and forcing Casemiro to mark that player, but not a perfect solution because the ball side left-back can't go out to challenge the ball. He should force Liverpool wide because he can't let that forward next to him get behind him; there would be no one there to mark them.

The second alternative would be to be more passive and have Casemiro pick up the player Bennett was originally jumping out to mark. Then, when the ball is played wide, the space is smaller, and Casemiro can get ahead of that player to cut off any passes into their feet from the wing or forward to their right. That would also allow the left-back to challenge the ball, with Bennett calmly shifting over to cover for them.
