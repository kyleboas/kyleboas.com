Understanding the why in regard to injuries is becoming more and more important as the schedule becomes more congested. Manchester United are the most interesting team to follow because of how many problems they've had.

Guillaume Van de Wege writing for the [United District](https://utddistrict.co.uk/man-utd-erik-ten-hag-injury-crisis-details/27/07/2024/):

> As intensity ramps up throughout the preparation phase, volume starts to decrease in anticipation of the first competitive games. Around the start of the competition phase, a complete cross-over occurs, where intensity is the primary factor between the two. Until the winter break (or end of the season, for some leagues), teams now enter a phase where they maintain the fitness built up throughout the preparation phase.
> 
> That crossover point is, however, not insignificant.
> 
> It was during that crossover window in August and September of 2023 that Manchester United sustained their first significant muscular injuries.

I would recommend reading the full post because Guillaume goes into great detail, and that same analysis translates to the other teams that are attempting to train under similar circumstances.

Anyone who has played some form of organized football can have an appreciation for how professional footballers have to prepare, but it is another thing to see the details of the planning.
