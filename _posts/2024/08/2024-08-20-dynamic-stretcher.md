The football terms we use on social media are a product of the character count we are forced to fit our ideas into. No one has time. If you can't get your point across, that reader will tab out.

Marco Lai, a match analyst for Cagaliari U20 and a writer, on his definition of [the difference between synthesis and analysis](https://marcolai.substack.com/p/football-analysis-on-social-media):

> The content we find on social media is often extremely rapid and accessible to all. It was created to capture attention in the shortest time possible and to be quickly consumed. This type of communication is, by definition, superficial. Football analysis videos on Instagram and TikTok rarely exceed one minute, and in that brief time span, it is impossible to provide a true analysis. What is offered is a synthesisâ€”a reduced and simplified version of reality.

I like short-form content. I think there is a market for overviews. I also like simple explanations. I don't think finding more words to explain something means it is a better explanation, but I agree that that style can produce superficial content.

It can also produce content that is harder to understand if the simple explanation doesn't translate. My favorite one is "dynamic stretcher."

You could flip that, though, and say there is a market of people who can't pick up on the obvious. 

What is obvious? It is not made for people who know what to look for; those people are bored because they know the answer. The problem is, how do you know if everyone else knows?

People who produce longer-form analysis are withholding that information to present it in a larger, longer piece. More words. I would rather go for micro-analysis. Dig deep and diagnose one concept, problem, or play. Try to get the maximum amount of detail.

Stitch all those plays together, and you get the full picture.
