Leicester City used a back-three, with the left-back further forward in possession. When they transition to defense, the right-winger is responsible for marking the far post. They showed why the right-winger is the most important player in this setup.

I have not included the names of the players because it would distract from the point that this is a larger issue. This isn't a problem with one player; this is an entire team's problem.

Everyone is familiar with this in-and-out of possession setup. Manchester City have used it; Arsenal, Liverpool, Newcastle, Chelsea, Englandâ€”almost every top English team has tried this at some point. Back-three, left-back pushes forward, double pivot, left-winger inverts, attacking midfielder, and center-forward central.

When the left-back moves wide, the entire defense has to shift over. Naturally, the left-back will be wide and higher because, in possession, they are almost acting as a left-winger.

When everyone shifts over, the right-back will leave someone free behind them, in their blind spot.

[Bukayo Saka](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/07/07/bukayo-saka-is-englands-most-important-player-against-gakpo-mbappe-and-nico-williams/) showed and continues to show how important that role is for a right-winger to cover the far post. The coordination between the right-back and the right-winger has to be spot-on. 

If the coordination is off, the opponent can target the left wing from the right side of the pitch. You would want to have the ball on the right side of the pitch because that means Leicester City's right-back will have a man on his blind side behind him.

The way teams behave when transitioning to defense and when in settled play, defending, is what separates the top teams from the bottom tier. 

[Manchester City](https://tacticsjournal.com/2023/11/14/manchester-city-dont-take-risks-when-they-defend/) and [Liverpool](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/02/18/liverpool-slow-down-the-ball-carrier-in-defensive-transition/) purposely slow down the opposition, electing not to engage with them when they lose the ball. This allows the forwards to get back to help defend. Like herding a pack of wolves. That is an effective way to transition to defense.

Leicester City engage and then follow the closest opposition player when transitioning to defense, disregarding the potential free players on the wings. This is where the communication breaks down.

The right-back is used to having his blind side covered by the right-winger, but when the right-winger is far up the pitch, there's no one to cover that man on the far post. 

First, the right-back should be made aware the right-winger isn't back, but as a team, they should notice this and then maybe not have the left center-back jump out to engage with the ball carrier. Stay back and compensate for the lack of numbers. 

Until they figure this out, attack Leicester City's left wing from the right side of the pitch. Switch and then shoot. Create chaos.
