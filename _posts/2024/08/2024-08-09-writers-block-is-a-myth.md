If you want to write about football, make your own blog, own access to your work, own your space, and then ship. Don't be afraid of being imperfect. It will never be perfect. Write like you talk.

The mentor I've never met and only emailed once (he answered), Seth Godin, coined that saying, "Write like you talk." He, and subsequently, I, am of the belief that writer's block is a myth because [no one gets talker's block](https://seths.blog/2011/09/talkers-block/).

That way of thinking changed the way I write. I do not have to overthink because this is how I talk.

If you are in front of a group explaining something, you only get one chance. You can rehearse what you want to say in your mind, but you can't go back and edit what you said, even though I do edit my writing, of course.

It is like going on a long walk with someone you know and then explaining to them what you saw or what you want to say. That is the reader. It is natural.

It is not perfect, and I don't want it to be because [it will never be perfect](https://seths.blog/2021/04/perfect-is-not-the-same-as-perfectionism/). I want to ship my idea.

The best posts are the ones, like this one, where the words come flowing out. No effort is needed.

I sit down at 8:00 p.m. One 600-word post normally takes me less than 30 minutes to write. The longest part of the process is me procrastinating, looking up each player's name so I can spell it correctly, and making the graphics. The writing takes minutes.

That is why I am able to put out a post every day. I write when I want, and the quality never dips because this is how I talk. That makes it easier to write, and then I can stockpile them. Yesterday's post might have been written two weeks ago.
