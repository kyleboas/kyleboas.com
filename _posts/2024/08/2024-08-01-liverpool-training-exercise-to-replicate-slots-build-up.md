During [Liverpool's open training](https://www.youtube.com/live/E4O1lF-57Wc?si=hjD7KUm0OGKuxlIx) they used this training exercise that simulates how they build up, with the trigger for the pass out being the opposition's forward press towards the center-back. The ball-side midfielder drops to receive.

The drill starts like this with two center-backs, two midfielders, and two forwards on the attacking side (red), with one player marking the center-backs, two players marking the midfielders, and one player marking the forwards in defense (green). This is used to practice playing out from the goalkeeper to the wings or through in on goal.

The ball gets played out by the goalkeeper, and then the center-backs pass back and forth. The goalkeeper doesn't get involved after the initial pass. 

The center-backs will not pass forward to the midfielders or forwards until the opposition defender presses them. Once that defender presses, they will then look to play a pass to the ball-side midfielder or forward.

The ball is played out, and then every move thereafter is natural to find the quickest pass out to the forwards, whether that be direct or back to the center-backs to combine with the midfielders. 

It is the quickness of the passing that sets Liverpool apart, as shown in [their first preseason match against Real Betis](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/07/27/arne-slot-shows-signs-of-balancing-liverpools-buildup/) and in their match against Arsenal.

Once they bait the press and trigger the pass, that pass forward, then back, and then bait the opponent's second line into pressing seems important to them. There is freedom to be spontaneous, but they are always unconsciously looking for and finding that pass. It is not a pre planned play but it is in their mind before they start passing forward.
