It is mind boggling to me why Arsenal do not play like they did in the first half every time they play Manchester City away from home. A title-winning team plays like that. On the front foot, pressuring the opponent into mistakes. They have enough quality to do it.

<!---more--->

Could you concede a goal? Everyone could concede a goal at any point in the game, whether you defend compact in your own half or in the opposition's half. 

This was my issue with Arsenal last season. This is what frustrated me when I watched them play. They had imposter syndrome. They are not inferior.

When it is April, with only a few games left in the season, when there is two to three days of rest and the team is tired, and you look at each draw or loss in a season, you will look back at this game and say, "We didn't sacrifice anything." They only played their way in moments [last season in March, at the Etihad](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/04/02/odegaard-on-the-turn/).

Leandro Trossard got a second yellow, red card. They had to defend deep in the second half to preserve the lead, but they were there to win the entire game.

As Pep Guardiola said before the match:

> Is 0-0 ever a good result? Yeah, when you play shit.

Some will argue that defending deep, with eleven men in the box, helps you conserve energy. Players don't chase the ball, they just wait for the opponent to gift the ball back. You can build a team to counterattack with fast wingers. I respect this way of playing, but when you have the quality they have to suffocate opponents in their own half, I think it is a waste of talent.

That is the difference between a team that is invincible and a team that could be a title contender. 

This game at the Etihad was the next phase of their project. They have the quality to beat anyone, in the same way they play at home. Whether it's Wolves at home, Atalanta in the Champions League, or Manchester City at the Eithad; they have the quality to control every game, but it is up to them if they do.
