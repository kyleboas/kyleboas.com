When Arsenal went down to ten men, I got an idea. Instead of having their defenders act as the providers and shooters, Manchester City could have moved two of their defenders to the front line, in the box, with Gvardiol and the forwards on the back line.

Manchester City put all of their forwards on the front line, with the defenders on the back line with Mateo Kovacic. Gvardiol was seen forward inside the box at times. 

Wouldn't you rather have the forwards who can score outside the box and cross, like Savinho, Gündoğan, Silva, and Doku, at the top of the box instead of the defenders? 

Kyle Walker has not scored from outside the box since the 2020/21 season, Ruben Dias since 2021/22, and Manuel Akanji has never scored from outside the box. All three aren't particularly good at creating either. 

It is a recipe for side-to-side action, with the occasional wayward shot or hopeful cross to Erling Haaland, who was double-teamed in the box. Which is what we got.

Instead, I don't think it's that risky to sub off one defender for a forward or midfielder. 

Move two defenders into the box with one defender, Gvardiol, staying back to help defend the counter. Keep the fast wingers like Grealish, Savinho, and Bernardo Silva back to act almost as fullbacks if there is a counterattack. Ruben Dias and Manuel Akanji wouldn't be that far away to recover to defend against a sustained attack.

I think it would be a net positive having Jack Grealish, Ilkay Gündoğan, Phil Foden, Bernardo Silva, and Savinho at the top of the box being a threat rather than waiting and watching on the front line in a straight line, with three defenders either side of each player.

You could even have Erling Haaland drop back periodically to offer up a shot at the top and drag defenders out to create more space within the box.

John Stones scored the goal to tie the game in the 97th minute after all. That was from a set piece but it should work from open play too because Arsenal weren't really trying to counter.
