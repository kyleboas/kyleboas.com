Something unusual happens when Arsenal plays against teams that defend in a mid-block. They get stuck in limbo in this middle ground where they can't attack the space behind the opposition's high line, and they can't pin the opposition back in their box.

Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, and Martin Ødegaard don't offer enough pace to threaten a run in-behind Brighton's high defensive line. 

They can attempt a run, but the timing of the runs isn't in sync with each pass. Say for example Kai Havertz; he is pealing off into space as Declan Rice receives the ball. By the time Rice takes his first touch, Havertz is still holding his run to stay onside.

Bukayo Saka is ready for a pass in-behind, but if the pass were to be played over the top, it would be him versus three or more other defenders because neither Kai Havertz nor Martin Ødegaard are ready to help.

Based on the way those ahead of the ball are making their runs forward and the timing at which they make the runs, it seems that the goal is to pin the opposition back into their own box so that Arsenal can pick away at them. 

Those runs create space for the man receiving the ball. Make the run before the ball is played; push a defender back, creating space behind the run. 

But every time Arsenal would work the ball close to Brighton's box, they'd work the ball back, and then Brighton would step out, back into that higher line, and Arsenal would have to reset again. 

The game was stuck, and the only way they could break the tension was to wait for Brighton to make a mistake, because they only need one. Lewis Dunk finally made that one mistake in the 38th minute, Kai Havertz is played through, and there is the opening goal. 

I'm not sure what the solution is right now, but [Aston Villa defends in a similar manner](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/08/25/arsenals-right-wing-malfunctions-against-aston-villa/), and they encounter the same challenges when attempting to attack against them.
