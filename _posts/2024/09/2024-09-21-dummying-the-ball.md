Dummying the ball is an underutilized way of disguising who the pass is intended for. Two players align with the passer, the man dummying the ball lets the ball run through their legs, and the third man receives. This plants the feet of the defenders.

The two players in **Figure 1.1** close in on the player dummying the ball. They think that player is going to take a touch, but they let it run through their legs to the center-forward. This creates confusion.

Then, in **Figure 1.2**, that player that dummies the ball can immediately peel off to look for the through ball into the box. The center-forward is ready to play that pass because this is practiced. 

Aligning on that diagonal is a conscious choice. All three players will know where each other are, and that's why they can execute this.

Even in a straight horizontal line, a dummy can be a powerful way to break into the box through a deep block.  

The players marking the forward dummying the ball are ready for that first touch in that tight space. The defenders behind him, marking the forward receiving the ball, are not ready to engage the ball. 

That deception buys the forward receiving a few seconds more time to play the ball through on their first touch, and the defenders marking the forward dummying the ball are frozen, stuck engaging the first touch as that forward surges into the box.

This also works to get the ball to the passer. The passer plays the ball, and then immediately moves. Pass and move. 

Everyone tracks the forward dummying the ball; they are frozen. The defenders naturally gravitate towards the forward receiving the ball, and then the ball can be played through to the passer as they move into the box. 

Then all three forwards can attack the box, with the passer either taking the shot or squaring the ball across the face of the box for the shot.

This is the power of aligning on the diagonal. It can open up angles for flicks and dummies out and through while in attack.

Dummying the ball is a powerful tool that is underutilized in today's game due to the fact that these diagonals are not being consciously organized.
