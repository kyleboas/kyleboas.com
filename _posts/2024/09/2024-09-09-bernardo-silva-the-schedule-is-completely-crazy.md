Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva thinks that the upcoming schedule is "absolutely absurd," and it is. It will be harder now more than ever to maintain a rhythm. He says that "the schedule is completely crazy."

Bernardo Silva:

> When players complain, people say that players shouldn't complain about the lives they have. And they're right because we are living a dream and doing what we do. 
> 
> On the other hand, the schedule is completely crazy. We’ve just received the news that we only have one day off for the League Cup game.
>
> We’ll probably play every three days for months. It’s been absolutely absurd. 
> 
> In the Champions League, if you don’t qualify for the round of 16 you still have to play two more games. 
> 
> It’s true that the squads are bigger, but I’m not going to say that it’s easy. It hasn’t been easy. I spend very little time with my family and friends. The amount of games we’re subjected to is absolutely absurd.

I think the players may and possibly should go on strike this season. It is the only way that we will see change, and [Rodri has hinted](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/07/13/rodri-talks-we-must-listen/) that is an option players have discussed in the shadows. 

Tactics is not just about the X's and O's on the pitch, movements, and structures. That is a part of the puzzle. In my opinion, fitness and mentality both have massive impacts on the tactic used from game to game.

Every team has to [find their rhythm](https://tacticsjournal.com/2023/09/30/rhythm-size-of-squads-and-schedule/) to maintain the confidence needed to win, and [players don't train](https://tacticsjournal.com/2023/09/22/we-dont-train/).

The organizers are cannibalizing the game for short-term gains.
