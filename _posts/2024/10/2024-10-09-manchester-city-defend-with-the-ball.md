Stop trying to fix Manchester City's ability to defend in transition and start looking at the game in the way Pep Guardiola does. Everything is framed around possession. Defend with the ball. When they look weak or concede from a transition, it is not down how well they defended the transition, the issues they look to resolve come from how and when they lose the ball.

Pep Guardiola after Manchester City's 3-2 close win to Fulham:

> We are a team more used to playing [with the ball] than focussing on these kind of things [defending/conceding less]. But you’re right; score goals and you have to try to be better [defensively]. We have margin to improve. You are right.

> If there's one player all the time making mistakes, next game they’re not going to play. It’s simple. You have to perform well. [...] Maybe I have to reflect on the goals, how it goes in, normally transition or set-pieces, because without Rodri we lose this power.

Pep is not talking about losing Rodri's defensive qualities; he is talking about his ability to maintain tempo and help them keep possession. Rodri knows where and when he can lose the ball, take risks, or stay safe.

When Rodri is on the pitch, they make fewer mistakes. When they make no mistakes, the opposition has very little chance of beating them.

They take risks in certain areas of the pitch because they know if the opponent regains possession, the counter won't be as threatening if they lose it someplace else. They don't take risks in risky positions. Everything is controlled. Guardiola seems to get the most angry on the sidelines when a risk is taken in a risky position. When that player knows they shouldn't have played that pass or attempted that dribble.

Manchester City lost the ball against Fulham in positions where their midfielders had no ability to help in transition. 

The advantage of this way of thinking is that they don't care if the profile of the holding midfielders is suitable in transition. They can afford to have slower, shorter, or less physical midfielders. They can afford to not care about letting the opposition get a shot off in transition. If anything, they encourage it because the sooner the opposition shoots, the sooner they get the ball back. 

The disadvantage is twofold. One, if they make mistakes, they will be giving up a ton of high-quality chances. Simple fix: make no mistakes with the ball. Two, we sometimes will see really boring or slow pragmatic play with the ball. [Possession without any progression](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/04/01/possession-without-progression/). Less risks.

I don't agree with this way of playing, but when you are suggesting solutions, have this in mind.
