Some personal news. This week, I will be going in for a planned surgery. That means I will unfortunately not be able to keep up with posting daily until I recover. I'll let you know how it goes in a week or more.

<!---more--->

I have been posting once a day (with a couple missed days) since April 2023. I do that because I like the consistency. The post goes out at 11:00 UTC every day; you don't even need a notification; you know it will be there. 

I am proud of the long streak I have been on. It is annoying that I have to break that streak, but I plan to go right back to it once I'm back.

If you try to contact me and I don't respond, don't worry. I won't be online for a bit.
