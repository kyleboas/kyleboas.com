It brings me joy seeing people join my [tactics community on Discord](https://discord.gg/pQuympz34q) despite the fact that I don't promote it. I put a link in the footer but nothing else. It's a fun place to talk about football and tactics, you should join.

For creators, you can share your content from social media or from your own blog with the rest of the community. 

It is a great place to get football news, data, visuals, videos, clips, team news by country all without ever having to log into social media because we have automated channels that grab that information from blogs and social media. 

It is an escape away from the divisiveness of social media. A group chat with meaningful but lighthearted discussions and debates about football.
