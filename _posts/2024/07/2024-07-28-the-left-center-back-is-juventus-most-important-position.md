It is no wonder why Thiago Motta wanted to bring Riccardo Calafiori with him from Bologna to Juventus because their most important player is the left center-back, due to their movement to the left in the buildup.

When the left-back, Jonas Rouhi, drops back to receive from the goalkeeper, he would normally have to play directly to the winger. That winger would then become trapped wide, with no one to play off of central. They'd either be forced back, force a pass central, or try to dribble down the wing. 

The moment one of the center-backs moves into the midfield, moving from inside to outside of the fullback, the play opens up. They are not passing and moving; they are moving in anticipation of the pass. Left center-back Facundo González moves into the half-space, and he can provide the wall pass from the fullback to the wing. That wall pass is important because it draws the opposition midfielders in to defend. That then opens space down the left wing. 

When Juventus don't move the center-backs, they use an orthodox 4-2-3-1 formation. The back four is where you expect them to be: two center-backs central with two fullbacks wide. They then work the ball through the wings. The movement from the center-backs is what makes them special.

One, I thought this would take weeks in-game for players to look relaxed in these unorthodox roles, but they look relaxed. Two, I thought the ease at which the center-back performs this action was [unique to Riccardo Calafiori](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/05/21/calafiori-continues-his-run/), but the fact that Facundo González can do this now is remarkable. What is unique about Calafiori is his ability to continue his run all the way up towards the front line.
