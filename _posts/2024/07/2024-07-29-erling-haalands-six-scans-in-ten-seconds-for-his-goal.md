Erling Haaland scanned ahead six times in the span of ten seconds before Oscar Bobb cut the ball back to him for his goal. We take each goal for granted because we don't pay close enough attention to the amount of scanning a player performs.

The play starts on the right wing. When Erling Haaland scans forward, he is going to notice the defenders are retreating back towards their own goal, and Haaland positions himself to receive behind the defenders at the top of the box. Oscar Bobb dribbles into the box, cuts it back to Haaland, and Haaland scores across goal into the bottom left-hand corner.

Not only is Haaland constantly scanning, he is also thinking ahead. If there is an early cross or if a player dribbles into the box, he needs to get open. This is his biggest strength. Most forwards would try to charge to the back post. 

The space is behind the defenders as they run back toward their own goal. Allow the defenders to run towards their own goal and then be ready for the cut-back at the top of the box.

When you see that live in the TV broadcast view, it looks simple. He stays back and then shoots when he receives the ball from Bobb. Nothing special, but there is so much thinking going on. 

Having to look at the ball, look over his shoulder, look at the ball, calculate where the space will be, prepare the body to receive the pass, time the run perfectly to meet the pass, and then execute the shot. 

You wouldn't know unless you squinted and zoomed in that he scanned six times. And this is only ten seconds; there are 5,400 seconds in a 90-minute match. With each attack, they are constantly scanning, passing, shooting, moving, and jockeying for position. It is not only physically draining; it is also mentally draining.
