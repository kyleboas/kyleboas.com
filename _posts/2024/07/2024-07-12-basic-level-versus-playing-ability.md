I was most looking forward to watching Pedri against Germany, and then, bam, in the 7th minute of the game, he is taken out by Toni Kroos in one tackle. We had crunching tackles before, but with less space, it is impossible to avoid them.

[Martin Rafelt made the good point](https://x.com/martinrafelt/status/1809201925952242109?s=46&t=YC8lQJTh43E_mBQW40Ct2g) that 'the physical level in the Premier League is so high that good players don't survive there':

Pedri to me is someone right now that falls into that category of a player with world-class playing ability who doesn't have the basic level to survive in a physical game. More specifically, a physical game with little space. 

As Messi said, [there is less space and the game is more 'tactical'](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/06/28/lionel-messi-says-football-is-too-tactical/). Lamine Yamal learned that you have to bulk up if you want to survive; even though he is young, just look at a picture of him then and now. Players are prioritizing muscle; you never saw this with [Neymar](https://youtu.be/ob-hr4_Znb8?si=yaATbafz-PuZ8muJ). Bukayo Saka is the new baseline; he is built like a rock.
