Now it is common to have the center-backs spread wide away when the goalkeeper has the ball, but Victor Valdés was the first goalkeeper to put this new idea from Pep Guardiola into action. An idea he laid out in their first conversation.

Goalkeeper Victor Valdés [telling the story](https://x.com/h3uno_/status/1810319241599762701?s=46&t=YC8lQJTh43E_mBQW40Ct2g) about his first conversation with Pep Guardiola before the 2008-2009 season for FC Barcelona:

> I remember my first conversation with Guardiola when he took over as coach. It was in his office at the Camp Nou. He had a tactics board with two small magnets on either side of the goal, just outside of the box.

> He said, "Do you know which players these two are?" I said, "Nope." And he said, "These are your center-backs." 
> 
> I had no idea what he was talking about; it sounded Chinese.
> 
> And he said, "When you've got the ball, this is where I want them to be."
> 
> I thought he was crazy. 
> 
> And then he said, "You'll pass to them, and it's from here that we'll build the play."
> 
> I still thought he was completely mad, but given that I'm a bit crazy myself, I felt in tune with him. So I told him the defenders would have to be brave and want the ball. And Pep said, "Don't worry, that's my job. I'll make sure they want it." And that's how it all started.

The center-backs push wide, which allows the fullbacks to move further upfield. That then frees the wingers to move infield and help overload the middle with the midfielders. 

At the time, in 2008, the spaces between defenders were large; the competitive advantage this one change brought was massive. 

It was "crazy" because if any of the players were unwilling or unable to play out like this, accurately passing, brave enough to play under immediate pressure from the front as they faced play, they would be completely exposed in the box once they turned the ball over.
