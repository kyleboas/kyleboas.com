Due to the versatility of the defenders, there are many different combinations Chelsea can use, but the main option they'll likely use is the right-back inverting, with the left-back operating as a left center-back in possession.

As we know from Chelsea manager [Enzo Maresca's Coaches' Voice video](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/05/31/how-enzo-maresca-transitions-to-defense-in-a-3-box-3/), he likes using a 3-2 sub-structure. Three center-backs and a double pivot in possession transform into a 4-4-2 formation out of possession.

Enzo Maresca when asked if he would use an inverted left-back:

> No, no. In these weeks, we try different situation; we try James inside, Reece. I watch his game when [...] he was loan from Chelsea to another club (Wigan in 2018/19); I don't remember now; he was playing as a midfielder. I watched some games during the summer, so he can do that, to be honest. Malo (Gusto) is trying to do that, and he's doing fantastic. Marc (Cucurrela), as you said, he can do that, and we also try a different situation, different players that they can do it.

By "different situation," he is referring to a different tactic where maybe the left-back doesn't invert and the right-back does, or neither fullback inverts into the midfield. 

He did not mention left-back Ben Chilwill because, as everyone was already aware, he can't play inside in the midfield. This is the new requirement for fullbacks; you either have to be able to play as either a center-back and fullback, a midfielder and a fullback, or both. Playing as a winger alone may not suffice, as most fullbacks typically lack the same level of skill at that position as natural wingers, whom they will be competing against for a position.

When you see the depth chart, you can understand why they would be okay with selling Conor Gallagher or Trevoah Chalobah, even though you could argue they should get a place in the team ahead of some of the players lower on the list in their position. There will be a lot of players with nearly equal talent and potential on the bench.
