When the inverted fullbacks are in line with the center-backs in a 2-3 sub-structure, the distance between all five players makes passing out awkward. Manchester City provided an example of this against Celtic in their opening preseason match.

One man is open, the right center-back, and then when they receive the pass, the second man has to get free. The focal point of the buildup deep in their half has to be the defensive midfielder because they are the ones that can drop in between the center-backs.

To me, it doesn't matter who you put in that position; the distance makes it hard to connect three passes, especially if those center-backs remain in their position. One from the center-back, to the defensive midfielder, and then out to a fullback. The fullback always receives under immense pressure.

The open pass will always be to the wings, but that is predictable, and if there's no pace on the wing, then it is hard to take advantage of the space offered to the offense. And with the midfielders higher up in the half-spaces, the center-forward is forced to be the main focal point in the buildup, to drop to receive if they want to play through the middle.

Maybe I'd like it more if the five players dynamically rotated position to open space central as they drag defenders out of position. That would then allow for the midfielders in the half-spaces to get room when they drop to receive because, when those five players are static, there is no space. 

If they are going to remain static, I'd rather open space in the half-spaces for the midfielders to drop by placing one or both of the fullbacks wide.
