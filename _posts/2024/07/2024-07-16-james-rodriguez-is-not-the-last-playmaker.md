The Copa America final was an ode to Messi, Di Maria, Otamendi, and the rest of Argentina's greats in potentially their final tournament, but the highlight was James Rodriguez of Columbia because they don't make many playmakers like him anymore.

James Rodriguez is 33 years old, but everyone remembers his stunning volley from 30 yards in 2014 during the World Cup in Brazil. He won't lose his edge in the same way an aging Cristiano Ronaldo, a speedy finisher, would. While your body gives out, the mind doesn't change, and Rodriguez's mind is his strength. I wouldn't describe Rodriguez as a "physical freak" like Ronaldo was. That instinct to take risks and the class to come up with unorthodox solutions to hard problems doesn't leave you. 

A playmaker's thinking before they receive the ball is different from that of other players. There is no data point to point to the way he plays. He floats around to find the next chance. He never takes the easy option. He finds the quickest solution. He doesn't wait for the ball in order to find the next pass. He maps out the pitch ahead in his head before he gets the ball, and then he is immediately a threat after his first touch.

Playmakers are still being made. The doom and gloom around the lack of creativity and spontaneity is justified because, as viewers have eyes, we can see they are not taking risks like they were before, but there are players like Cole Palmer who do take risks on every action. When you see Palmer succeed, it is hard to be pessimistic about the future. 

The way James Rodriguez plays is the way I hope Lionel Messi, Kevin De Bruyne, and Mohamed Salah play as they inch towards retirement because it doesn't require them to rely on the physical side of their game. Roam slowly, pick out passes, and focus on the next pass without having to sprint and dribble.
