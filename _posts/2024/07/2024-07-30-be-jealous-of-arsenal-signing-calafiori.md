We should be jealous of Arsenal for signing Ricardo Calafori because he is the poster child for the modern defender, a combination of what Ben White, Jurrien Timber, Oleksander Zinchenko, and Jakub Kiwior combined into one. Versatility is in.

He can play in the center of defense, wide left as a fullback, inverting into midfield, starting in the midfield, running through the channels, and overlapping wide. He is tall but nimble, not awkward on the ball, and fast. I'm sure he can play on the right side of the defense. Top teams need multiple Calafiori's. 

This versatility to play anywhere is what will be needed if teams want to break free from the zonal approach. I don't want to see him shackled to one position. To get everything out of him, you have to let him move where he wants to move. 

Midfielders that can play as defenders or fullbacks, central defenders that can play as midfielders or fullbacks, wingers that can play as fullbacks or center-forwards, fullbacks that can play as wingers or midfieldersâ€”this should be where the game in Europe is headed again, in my opinion. 

Everyone except for the goalkeeper will need to play in at least two positions. That helps when dealing with the congested schedule, but it will allow teams to be unpredictable. 

I really wanted to see him play again for Thiago Motta at Juventus because he brought that out of him. Now the question is, will Arteta allow him to show that spontaneity that got him signed, or will he play a more reserved role?
