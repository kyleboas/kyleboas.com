The system England used against Serbia is dependent on progressive passes through the center and the left-back remaining active down the wing, and when fatigue set in, that is when things changed.

Notice the lack of straight passes forward into that zone where Phil Foden can turn. To get the most from Foden, you need to funnel the ball through that zone. Play the ball into him with his back to goal, and then he can turn towards the penalty box. 

Not playing this pass for an entire half is the equivalent of not passing the ball down the right wing to Bukayo Saka. You might as well not start Foden if you are not going to play this pass. Foden is no Jérémy Doku, he won't dribble past five people. He is a jack-in-a-box that you whined up with the pass to pop out of the space, pass, and then start again.

Of the two progressive passes Declan Rice played to Phil Foden in the first half, neither were forward, both sideways, and neither were in that zone central. 

This is the problem with having Declan Rice as the anchor. This will go overlooked because of how good of a footballer he is, but he is unwilling to play this pass forward between the lines. He passes from side to side, left to right, like a center-back. His mind and thinking are more similar to those of a center-back like John Stones, not Rodri. He is not a natural six and is used to Arsenal playing through the wings. Jorginho or Partey find the cutting passes through the center between the lines. Rodri finds that pass and slows the play down to allow Foden time and space on the ball to turn.

Credit to John Stones. Stones has learned how to think like Rodri—to think like a six. He was the first one to play the forward pass into Foden in that zone in the final third. You play that pass, and then the entire attack opens up. It is a small window to pass into, but that is where Foden needs the ball. The reception looks impossible, but for Foden, it is not. Credit also to Marc Guéhi, the other player looking for that central pass into Bellingham and Foden.

Italy coach Luciano Spalletti talked about Nicolo Barella starting against Albania after he missed training due to injury:

> The fact that he missed a few training sessions at this stage of the season can only be good for him. We all say, we come to the end of the season, we're really tired, we're tired, we're tired, exhausted, but one guy who's missed two training sessions sessions, okay, he shouldn't have necessarily played because he missed two training sessions. No, he played because he rested up. It's actually the contrary, it's the opposite. 

Fatigue should be talked about first after this long season.

Phil Foden can invert from the left wing because Kiernan Trippier is there to push up on the left. When Trippier isn't there, Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham have to work harder, covering the space Trippier would be occupying. That takes players out of the center of the pitch.

When you take players out of the center of the pitch, then England can't progress on the ground; they have to go vertical, which they did. This issue compounds because Declan Rice only passes side to side. He wasn't finding the least obvious pass. Trent Alexander-Arnold was progressing the ball, but due to the fact he is wide right, he can often thread a pass on the ground to Kane, Bellingham, or Foden.

When Trippier was active, this dynamic worked because Trent could progress through the center to Foden and Bellingham, and then they could pass out to Bukayo Saka and Trippier on the wings. When Trippier isn't active, Trent Alexander-Arnold has to go long or through the wing.

When England goes vertical, the game is lost because that does not play into their strengths as a team. That midfield is not great in transition, Kane is not going to win every aerial duel, and with Trippier back on his own end, there is no outlet on the left wing. 

They have to slow the pace of the game down to a more deliberate speed and focus on funneling the ball through the center of the pitch to distribute into the box or wide to be crossed.
