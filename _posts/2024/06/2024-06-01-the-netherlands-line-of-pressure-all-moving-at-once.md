Like a line of thunderstorms, the Netherlands' second line rushes the ball carrier all at once. This unique pressing pattern is effective at overwhelming a team like Brazil because it allows their players to move with more freedom.

At first, they lie in wait, and then pounce as a unit together. The diagonal they create in the press signals the direction they want the ball to be played. 

They did this a lot immediately after losing the ball. They didn't allow Brazil to advance past their second line. It wasn't a half-hearted effort. It is all or nothing; everyone joins in.

Once they commit to the press, everyone has to also commit to the tackle and get a foot in. Brazil can never feel comfortable on the ball. Each touch is met with a lunge.

The diagonal that forms is the most prominent and consistent figure, though. I've never seen a team do this. I am imagining someone yelling "now!" like in medieval times in battle, and then they charge. 

It is effective against relational play because relationalism promotes play in close proximity. By charging as a unit, the opposition can't advance. There is a wall ahead of them in the space where they would want to [create their own diagonal](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/05/22/pickpockets/). Counter the diagonal with a diagonal press.
