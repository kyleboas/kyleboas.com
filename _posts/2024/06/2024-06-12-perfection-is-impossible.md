Tennis is a mental game and there are parallels between it and taking risks in football. Roger Federer says 'perfection is impossible' and that thinking 'frees you to fully commit to the next point with intensity, clarity, and focus.'

> Perfection is impossible.
> 
> In the 1,526 singles matches I played in my career, I won almost 80% of those matches. But what percentage of points did I win? 54%.
>  
> In other words, even top ranked tennis players win barely more than half the points they play. When you lose ever second point on average, you learn not to dwell on every shot.
> 
> You teach yourself to think: 'Okay, I double faulted, it's only a point.' 'Okay, I came to the net and I got passed again, it's only a point.'
>  
> Even a great shot, an overhead backhand smash that ends up on ESPN's top ten playlist – that too is just a point. 
> 
> Here's why I'm telling you this. When you're playing a point, it has to be the most important thing in the world. And it is. But when it's behind you, it's behind you. This mindset is crucial – because it frees you to fully commit to the next point with intensity, clarity, and focus.

Fully commit to the challenge, dribble, pass, or shot with clarity. Ignore all the fails and trust your ability.
