Kylian Mbappe says Euro 2024 is 'more complicated than the World Cup' because 'all the teams know each other, we play against each other all the time. Tactically it’s very similar football.' I agree.

The wildcard teams tactically in the World Cup, that made it past the group stage, were Japan, Brazil, Argentina, Senegal, and Morocco. 

It is more of a game of who has the best quality squad in the Euro's. Everyone plays roughly the same way. International friendlies throughout the season between each other means that each team knows what to expect. 

That makes it more complicated because the margins will be smaller. Teams will gain when they deviate from what they are used to.
