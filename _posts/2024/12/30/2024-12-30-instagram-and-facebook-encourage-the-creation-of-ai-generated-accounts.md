Cristina Criddle and Hannah Murphy for the Financial Times:

> The Silicon Valley group is rolling out a range of AI products, including one that helps users create AI characters on Instagram and Facebook, as it battles with rival tech groups to attract and retain a younger audience.
> 
> “We expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do," said Connor Hayes, vice-president of product for generative AI at Meta.
> 
> “They’ll have bios and profile pictures and be able to generate and share content powered by AI on the platform . . . that’s where we see all of this going," he added.
> 
> Hayes said a “priority" for Meta over the next two years was to make its apps “more entertaining and engaging", which included considering how to make the interaction with AI more social.
> 
> He said hundreds of thousands of characters have already been created using its AI character tool — which launched in the US in July, with plans to expand its access in the future — but most users have kept them private so far.

What are we gaining from this, and I'm not sure what they are gaining from this?

I can't imagine a situation in which I would enjoy interacting with a bot, other than to gain information from it.

All this does it make me want to not engage with platforms that want this to be the norm, and post only on a blog that I own and can control.
