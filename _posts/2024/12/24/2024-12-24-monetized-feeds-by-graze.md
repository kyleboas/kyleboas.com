Graze Social:

> Here’s the plan: we’re giving you the tools to pick and publish sponsored posts in your feeds, at rates that you determine. You have complete editorial control over who your sponsors are! This means anyone with an audience on Bluesky can build a community or business on top of the Graze platform.
>
> We’ve been running this quietly with early testers, and in the coming days, we will be rolling out these tools and services for everyone. You'll be able to flag your feed as monetizable on Graze, and other users on Graze will be able to send you proposals for sponsored campaigns. You’ll also be able to monetize your own feed by the same mechanism. We’ll facilitate the payments to ensure you get paid by your sponsors, and we’ll take a small service fee to keep our systems and people online - but the majority of the sponsorship money for your feed goes into your pocket. We believe that this will help upend the traditional relationship between users of social media and the platforms that place them at their mercy. We want to empower a new class of users to help us define what the next generation of social media will look like.

The more customizable the better.

Those that are technically savvy should want to get out ahead of this because if people migrate to Bluesky, this could be a fantastic opportunity.
