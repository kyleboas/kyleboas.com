Seth Godin:

> Get a cheap digital tape recorder. Go on a walk with someone you want to teach about your topic of expertise. Spend half an hour explaining, in the most cogent way you can, person to person, what they might learn from you.
> 
> When youâ€™re simply talking and walking, teaching from experience and anecdote, your best voice arrives.
> 
> Go ahead and transcribe the recording and your first draft is done.

Write like you talk. It works.
