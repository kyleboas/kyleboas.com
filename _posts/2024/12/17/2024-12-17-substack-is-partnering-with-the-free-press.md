Substack:

> "We’re partnering with The Free Press to build this first version of Substack’s enterprise offering while we learn how to best support organizations of this nature. This work will benefit all publishers on the platform. As we develop the toolset through an extended private beta over the coming year, we plan to take features designed for The Free Press and make them available for general use in Substack."

Enterprise sounds expensive. Sounds like more basic features behind a paywall.

> "The Free Press, like Substack, is also dedicated to a business model based on subscriptions."

Making a free Substack newsletter has to be made a subscription eventually. I can't imagine they are making enough money to sustain this model.
