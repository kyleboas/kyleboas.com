Something has to give.

All the change on the internet is building, and building, and building to a crescendo. 

The resolution is going to have to be different from the norm now, because it can't continue the way it is going. I don't think it is sustainable.

I find it quite annoying that an entire generation of people are unaware of how the internet was fifteen or twenty or years ago. This is all they know.

And note to self: Never buy a computer that runs Windows in S Mode.
