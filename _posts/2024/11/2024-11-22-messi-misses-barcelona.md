Lionel Messi:

> "We still have in our mind a return to live in Barcelona,” he told TV3. “My kids, my wife and I miss Barcelona a lot. We have friends there and left a lot of things behind when we moved.
> 
> “My kids are Catalan. I have lived most of my life there and I feel from Barcelona. You never know where life will take you, but the intention is to live in Barcelona because it’s our home.”

Friendly reminder to watch more Inter Miami matches because he isn't going to play forever.
