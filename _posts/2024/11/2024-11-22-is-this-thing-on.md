title: "Is this thing on"
---

I have always wanted a link blog. A place to share what I am reading or watching, without being constrained by a character limit. I have finally made it; here it is.

If you are someone who likes to share things with others, you should make one, and I will be making a tutorial on how I made this website and [tacticsjournal.com](https://tacticsjournal.com) soon. It is a very simple, free, process.

I like minimal design; this site's minimalistic design is by design, but the beauty of making your own website is that you can make it look like whatever you want. And the design might evolve; I might change my mind.

I continue to like the idea of talking to people, and Bluesky is a much friendlier place to be when compared to X, formerly Twitter. All of my longer posts will be shared here and then posted on my Bluesky account at [@kyleboas.com](https://bsky.app/profile/kyleboas.com).

If you have any suggestions for things to read or watch, please send them to me at <a href="mailto:kyle@tacticsjournal.com">kyle@tacticsjournal.com</a>.
