Michael Cox for The Athletic:

> This was once Walker’s default approach to the game, but in recent years he has tucked inside, playing as part of a back three or moving inside into midfield. Asking him to be a constant overlapper on Saturday was largely out of keeping with his performances in other matches this season, as [the below chart](https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2024/11/24092816/walker_touchmap.png) demonstrates.

> The reason Guardiola has moved away from using overlapping full-backs like this is because it opens up space for the opposition when possession is lost. And, realistically, if you want Walker to be pushing forward onto the last line of the opposition defence, you can’t expect him to be completely solid defensively, too.

I too agree that it isn't always Kyle Walker's fault. I don't agree that he doesn't always look for the overlap. He should because that is one of the two things he is actually good at doing. He has good recovery speed in defense and he is good at making a quick overlapping run.

I'm more annoyed with Pep Guardiola allowing him to do essentially whatever he wants on the right, acting like a conventional fullback, when you know you'll be turning over the ball. 

You know [he is not a positionally aware defender](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/03/11/kyle-walker-jumping-in-transition-nearly-cost-manchester-city-against-liverpool/). 

You know [how much more effective Tottenham can be when they are allowed to counter](https://tacticsjournal.com/2024/03/16/how-i-use-stathead-fbref/).

Although having Josko Gvardiol wide open on the left was great, that game against Tottenham screamed back-four.
