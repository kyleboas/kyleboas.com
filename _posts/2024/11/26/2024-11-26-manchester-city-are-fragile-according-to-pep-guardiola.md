Pep Guardiola:

> It will be a tough season for us and we have to accept it. We lost a lot of games lately, we are fragile and of course we needed a ­victory. We were playing at a good level but the first time something ­happened we had problems. I don’t know if it is mental. The first goal ­cannot happen and the second as well. After that we forget what happens.
> 
> Three episodes, they didn’t allow us what we needed to win for many reasons, not just in terms of qualification or get the points to go through. Other reasons. It is what it is, difficult to swallow right now.

I don't think it is mental in the sense that they are afraid. What I saw were three occasions that showcased how tired they are. Three simple mistakes that a fully fit Josko Gvardiol, Nathan Ake, and Manuel Akanji would not make, if they were given the chance to rotate in and out of the lineup. This is a problem that can only be solved with more rotation.
