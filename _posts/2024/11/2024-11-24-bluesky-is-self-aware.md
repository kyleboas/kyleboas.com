Dan Abramov on Bluesky:

> i know everyone’s tired of talking meta level but i’m really happy that i finally was able to cut over to posting just here. twitter felt pretty addictive even this spring and summer. but as our app got less wonky and we added features like quotes, it reached the good enough level for me personally
> 
> there’s still a bunch of quality of life type annoyances (just fixed lightbox — good; still need to fix broken gestures like drawer swipe, fix abrupt refresh behavior, make the pager feel nice or replace it) and bigger product todos (better feeds, more responsive algo) but it’s getting there

Dan is a developer at Bluesky and it is nice to know they know there is still room for improvement. They are self-ware. 

The Twitter developers did do a good job over the years. Their app is the incredibly responsive, highly addictive, snappy. Then X took over, and now we are here with the app filled with spam, unmoderated hate, and scams.

I'm sure if Bluesky doesn't recreate that experience or a new better experience, some other third-party developer will soon.
