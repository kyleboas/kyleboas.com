Khéphren Thuram:

> I love watching the game. I love watching good players. But Thierry Henry always told me, ever since I was small, that when you watch a game, don’t watch it like a fan. Analyse what’s happening. Why did he do that? Why is he in that position?
> 
> I watched a lot of Yaya Touré, Paul Pogba, Patrick Vieira because they were taller players. They were box-to-box, they ran with the ball, they had that technical ability, they had that intelligence.
> 
> But then I also looked up to Thiago Alcântara because I needed to look at a small player. Because I didn’t want people to say: ‘Oh, he’s just tall and strong, no technical ability.’ So I looked to Thiago and what he can do in small spaces. I try to take a little bit of everyone. I’m not yet at their level. But I’m trying.
