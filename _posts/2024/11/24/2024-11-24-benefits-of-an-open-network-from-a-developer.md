Emily Liu, a developer at Bluesky: 

> I sometimes describe Bluesky as a browser with a whole marketplace of extensions, made possible by its open network. Perhaps you want a Tweetdeck-like experience of Bluesky? There’s [deck.blue](https://deck.blue/). A no-code way to create custom feeds? Try out [SkyFeed](https://skyfeed.app/) or [Bluesky Feed Creator](https://blueskyfeedcreator.com/). Maybe you want features like drafts or post scheduling that Bluesky doesn’t have yet. Well, the creators of apps like [Skeets](https://www.skeetsapp.com/), [Tokimeki](https://tokimeki.blue/), and [Skywalker](https://bsky.app/profile/skywalker.thereforeiam.eu) provide that for you.

> Let’s zoom out a bit further. Bluesky is actually just one app built on this open network, which is called the AT Protocol (atproto). If Bluesky is “open Twitter," then you could imagine an “open Reddit" or an “open Instagram" too. In fact, this is becoming a reality now, with apps like [WhiteWind](https://whtwnd.com/) (for blogging), [Frontpage](https://frontpage.fyi/) (a web forum), [Smoke Signal](https://smokesignal.events/) (an events app), and [Bluecast](https://bluecast.app/) (an audio app).

The more I learn about Bluesky, the more I think this is the coolest service and experiment on the web.
