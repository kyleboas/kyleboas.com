Vincent Kompany is misunderstood. He will either flop or be wildly successful managing Bayern Munich; there is no in-between. Burnley played as if they had Manchester City's squad, regardless of whether they had the quality to execute.

In today's game, any manager can underperform. Kompany is a manager who should do better with a better squad. He has a special ability to extract the maximum from his team, punching above his weight in possession.

People knock him, but watch their top goalscorer in the Championship, Nathan Tella, at Bayer Leverkusen; watch Ian Maatsen at Borussia Dortmund. They both played for Burnley last season. They were missing that extra quality in the lineup. Wilson Odobert brought some of that, but it's not the same. 

Burnley's lineup in the Championship the season they were promoted was stronger than the one they had in the Premier League. They didn't replace the players they lost. They tried to replace goalkeeper Arijanet Muric with an exciting English prospect in James Trafford. The loan of center-forward David Datro Fofana from Chelsea came too late to make a difference.

I don't think many managers would be able to save them from relegation based on the lower budget they had and the recruitment. Bold choices for young talent didn't pan out. He did completely transform the way they play to help them get promoted.

Kompany is the default generic positional coach with all the extra stats in leadership. [He uses a high line] (https://tacticsjournal.com/2023/09/03/burnley-sit-too-deep-and-overcommit-to-the-ball-carrier/). He likes using the 3-box-3 midfield formation in possession. [He'll have the goalkeeper come out to help in the build-up] (https://tacticsjournal.com/2023/08/04/burnley-basic-shape-in-and-out-of-possession/). What you see is what you get; he is somewhat predictable. He has a way he likes to play, and brute force his way through games by playing that specific way regardless of the opponent or what his squad looks like. 

I could see him using a back-four to start, which then shifts into that 3-box-3 formation. Someone of Joshua Kimmich's profile would be important, because he can play both at fullback, holding midfield, and as an outside center-back. Like Benjamin Pavard in the season prior.

It's a very solid base for players like Alexsander Pavlovic and Jamal Musiala to work from. He likes quick, fast-paced passing sequences, and that requires highly technically gifted players.

His former manager, Pep Guardiola, has been singing his praises ever since the former Manchester City captain retired:

> It doesnâ€™t matter if he was relegated with Burnley. I have a high opinion about his work, as a person, his personality, knowledge of the game, how he handles the media.
> 
> Vincent Kompany will become a future Man City manager, mark my words. Yeah, it will happen for sure. You will call me when this is going to happen.

I'm confident that with more experience, he can eventually succeed, but if he doesn't, that is football. I respect the risk Bayern Munich is taking.
