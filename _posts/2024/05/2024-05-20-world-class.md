> I definitely don’t see myself as world-class. I’ve got to score in big games and finals to be world class. I’m capable of doing that, so it’s something I strive for.

> Players such as Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe and Cristiano Ronaldo are way above me at the moment. But I could be there one day. It’s all about taking small steps in the right direction. I just want to take my Manchester City form into the England national team.

The goal from outside the box at the Santiago Bernabéu to level the score two-to-two was world-class. The two goals against West Ham to win Manchester City their fourth consecutive Premier League title were world-class. 

It is one thing to contribute to a team that won an Under-17 World Cup, an English Super Cup, four English League Cups, two English FA Cups, a UEFA Super Cup, six Premier League titles, a FIFA Club World Cup, or a Champions League title. It's another thing to be the talisman in a title winning team. 

Deserved Premier League Player of the Season.
