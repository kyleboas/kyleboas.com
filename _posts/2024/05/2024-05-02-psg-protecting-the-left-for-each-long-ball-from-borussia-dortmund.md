tweet: "Luis Enrique says PSG kept Nuno Mendes back in the rest-defense to protect 'the left side and allow a 2v1 against Bradley Barcola to be in position for each long ball' from Dortmund. A lot of responsibility was placed on Dembélé out-of-possession."

Luis Enrique in a [post-match press conference](https://youtu.be/zdAUKgwiK18?si=jx7k5NVFi8vVN_FS) explaining how PSG prepared to defend the long ball against Borussia Dortmund:

<!---more--->

> A player like Füllkrug, a very tall player and powerful to play long ball to. We have tried to protect ourselves on [our left] and allow a two-v-one against Bradley Barcola to be in position for each long ball. To have either our winger or our interior with the possibility of helping. To defend those long balls. 
>  
> Dortmund is a very well-worked team. It has those two options. If you don't pressure them well, they are capable of outplaying you. If you pressure them well, they play a long ball.

Even though they conceded the one goal from a long ball, a bit of poor organization with their back-line to keep Füllkrug onside, I think was a solid plan to defend against the counter, to not leave themselves vulnerable. 

Nuno Mendes always stays back, that's what Luis Enrique is referring to when he says that they left Bradley Barcola two-v-one. Mendes will never help Barcola because he stays back in the rest defense with defenders Lucas Hernández and Marquinhos. 

I prefer Dembélé when he stays on the touchline. Hakimi wasn't as effective one-v-one when he received facing play against Adeyemi and Maatsen. Mendes can't get forward because PSG wanted Hakimi forward on the right-wing, to allow Dembélé to invert.

PSG wanted Dembélé to invert because they wanted him to man-mark Dortmund's holding midfielder, Emre Can, or provide an added option in defensive transition if one of the "interiors" midfielders got further forward, like Warren Zaire-Emery, for example. 

That was a lot of responsibility to place on Ousmane Dembélé. If he drops his attention, the space in front of PSG's second line is fairly open, as the midfield are preoccupied following their markers back into their own half.
