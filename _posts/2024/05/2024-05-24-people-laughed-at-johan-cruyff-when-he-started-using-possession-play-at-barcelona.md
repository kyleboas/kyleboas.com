[Johan Cruyff discussing where the term "tiki-taka" came from] (https://youtu.be/r0OVauT-yEk?si=K8ob49JixFnpNKvr):

> Tiki-taka — That's something like this where we play the ball as quick as possible, and these sorts of things. When we started in Barcelona (in 1988) to do possession play.
> 
> It's the responsibility of the ball, where you play, how you play — controlling the ball is the basis of football.
> 
> In the beginning, that was something people laughed about because they didn't understand that it was football. Until it had the results and people enjoyed it, people loved it, and now it's a fantastic world.
