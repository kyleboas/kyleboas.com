Everyone has different styles but it's not enough to demand and explain with words. The new generation of coaches are actively participating in training. Xabi Alonso [according to Granit Xhaka](https://youtu.be/troM9efh2Wk?si=VwwZONHixtKOZ7VP) is "an example of a new generation of coaching".

<blockquote>
I mean, Xabi was an unbelievable midfielder. He won everything. Only the Europa League not, because he never played Europa League but otherwise he's an example of a new generation of coaching. I think he's not only in the meeting and the tactical board, but he's showing you stuff.

Passing for example, this ball, where it was going everywhere in the social media. And of course, this type of different feeling when you are his player because you can see what he means. And to have someone like this with this experience, with this personality, it gives you a lot of confidence and just to do so much more than you did before.

[65% of the population is visual learners](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6513874/). You shouldn't need to learn a language to play football. The language is movement of the ball and of the players. 

The coaches that can bridge the gap with their own ability to play have an advantage over others. They can transform any idea into play quickly because they can demonstrate live what they want. 

Then the players try replicate it. But they'll have an easier job trying to replicate something demonstrated to them rather than explained to them.

That may be one of the reasons why Xabi Alonso has been able to have so much success with Bayer Leverkusen in such a short period of time.
