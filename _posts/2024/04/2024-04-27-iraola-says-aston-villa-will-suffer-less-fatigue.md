Bournemouth Manager Andoni Iraola's comment on how Aston Villa aren't as affected by fatigue compared to most teams:

<!---more--->

> I knew that the physical thing was not going to be key.
>  
> It is very difficult to open the game against Villa because they keep the game very well under control with the keeper, with Pau [Torres], with [Ezri] Konsa. They have a very good structure. They don't lose it, they have confidence in their build-up.

> You could see against Lille, even with extra-time, there was nobody with cramp, nobody asking for changes. If you see the game [between Man] City and Real Madrid, there were seven or eight players asking to be changed. Villa games, normally, they keep it more controlled. And they do it very well. 

[Adam Bate's post for Sky Sports](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12037/13120909/aston-villa-s-style-of-play-under-unai-emery-led-by-emi-martinez-helps-beat-fatigue-by-resting-in-possession) highlights all the key points on how Bournemouth adapted to compensate for the disparity in fitness between the two sides.

The main data point as to why Aston Villa have so much control is Emi Martinez. He leads the league in time on the ball at 5,621 seconds, ahead of all outfield players in the Premier League.
