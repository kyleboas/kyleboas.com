If I had to show someone one play that showcases Aitana Bonmati's best qualities, on and off the ball, it would be this one. Awareness, scanning, anticipation, acceleration, touch, close-control, la pausa, and intelligence. Others can learn from it.

Bonmatí knows that run is being made ahead so she lets Walsh know she should take her time. The more time Walsh and Guijarro take, the more space Bonmatí has as the Chelsea defense organize. When they organize, they get in that more predictable shape, and the run creates the pocket.

Once she scans, she sees the run again and then begins her run, anticipating the pass from Guijarro.

    <figcaption>Figure 1.8 - Aitana Bonmatí performs a step-over to lock the defender in place.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The first touch is close to her body, which draws in the Chelsea defender from her right, opening space to the right. The second touch then locks the defender's knees in, with her hips pointed towards Bonamtí's left side. The defender's back is now to the space, and she'll have to fully rotate her hips to track Bonmatí when she takes her next touch.

    <figcaption>Figure 1.9 - Aitana Bonmatí scans ahead after taking the touch to her right.</figcaption>
</figure> 

This is the critical part. Bonmatí scans ahead to the two defenders. 

One, if she takes the shot towards the far post, instead of waiting, it will likely be blocked by either the lead defender, Niamh Charles, or last defender, Buchanan. 

Two, if she takes a touch, Buchanan may either shield the goalkeeper's vision when Bonmatí takes the shot, if Buchanan overruns the ball, or the ball might deflect off Buchanan.

    <figcaption>Figure 1.12 - Aitana Bonmatí's contact with the inside of her foot for the shot.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The touch gives Bonmatí the necessary separation from Charles, and Buchanan is in a position where she could either block the shot or it will deflect off her and into the goal. Added level of unpredictability for the goalkeeper if the ball deflects.

    <figcaption>Figure 1.14 - Ball bounces into the bottom left hand corner near the post.</figcaption>
</figure> 

The ball deflects off Buchanan, between her legs, and the ball trickles into the bottom left hand side of the net. 

In a situation where most players would rush to shoot, Aitana Bonmatí knows when to go and when to slow down. It was not a great shot, it appeared to be going straight towards the goalkeeper before it was deflected, but the thought was there to create a situation in which a deflection was more likely to happen than not.
