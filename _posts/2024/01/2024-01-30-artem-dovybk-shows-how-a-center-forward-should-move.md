The center-forward should be constantly moving and looking to time the distance of the separation between their marker to either pin or get open, like Artem Dovbyk did in this Girona goal.

This closing of the separation and push from Dovybk is used in anticipation of the pass from the wing. It both opens up space behind his marker for Viktor Tsigankov to run onto, distracts his marker from watching the ball, and prepares his marker's body for the next movement.

Now that the marker has been pushed back, and off-balance, Dovybk can push off into space to open himself up as an option to receive the ball.

Once he sees the pass will be played to Cristian Portu, he stands still, forcing his marker to stay with him. He's pinned. They can't go to challenge Portu because if they do, they'll leave Dovybk free as a bird.

And then finally Dovybk opens himself up when his marker dismarks to challenge Portu.

Girona have won the positional chess match, 3v2. They have the advantage, checkmate. Impeccable timing from Artem Dovybk. This is how a center-forward should move and think.
