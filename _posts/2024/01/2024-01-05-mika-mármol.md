Mika Mármol of Las Palamas is a 22-year-old, exciting ball-playing left-footed center-back. Here are the positives and negatives I took from his performance against Barcelona.

He is 181cm and 71kg; not short but not tall, and on the slimmer side. He's agile and quick like a half-back but deceptively strong, tall enough to be a center-back in my opinion.

He is a very solid tackler, normally patient, waiting for the correct time to attempt a tackle, but he has a tendency to lunge at the ball at the wrong time in the box. He panics a bit, throwing off his body.

Here he attempts to win back the ball when it drops to Sergi Roberto but he's hesitant, not wanting to make a mistake and bring Sergi down.

The positive is that when Ferran Torres takes the shot, he purposely lifts his foot to cover the shot high. The goalkeeper covers the shot low, he covers the shot to the top corner.

But most of the time, he makes timely tackles like this one—firm and accurate.

</figure> 

He's fast and has great awareness. Las Palmas play a high-line offside trap, so he has to remain vigilant about where to place himself to intercept passes like this one. You can rely on him to cover passing lanes in transition and win back the ball.

</figure> 

He's an intelligent player without the ball. He noticed here he could get away with using his body to shield the ball from Lewandowski as it fell, to easily win back possession for his team.

A weakness is his heading power. He's strong, like I said, but his headers are somewhat weak. In this instance, he heads it out, which is good position-wise, but he doesn't get a lot of power on the header out. It lands to a Barcelona player on the edge of the box for a shot.

</figure> 

Here he wins a header from a cross on an attacking corner against Araujo, one of the strongest center-backs in Europe, but he doesn't get a lot of power on the header, and it goes marginally wide of the goal.

</figure> 

When you mix both his intelligence and tackling ability together, you get a sequence like this. He holds with the high line but doesn't give up on the play. He moves with the ball and quickly dispatches Raphinha shortly after he receives the ball.

A lot of Las Palmas play runs through Mármol on the left side and goalkeeper Alvaro Vallés. Mármol is a technical player, great with his feet, never unsure when receiving the ball. Never rushed when he has the ball. He'll let the play develop.

He acts as an extra midfielder at the back. I'd feel comfortable having him in the midfield. His chipped passes forward into the midfield down the wing were well-weighted and accurate.

He didn't play many remarkable passes this match but only had one memorable error when he attempted a back-pass. He didn't get enough power on it, and Vitor Roque nearly beat Alvaro Vallés to the ball.

They don't make a lot of center-backs like him that are left-footed, mobile, a great tackler, quick, and able to dribble and pass with relative ease. One to watch.
