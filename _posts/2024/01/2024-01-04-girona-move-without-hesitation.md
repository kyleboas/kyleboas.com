Outside of their finishing, Girona's ability to move without hesitation is what impresses me the most. They lose the ball then immediately set up a perfectly choreographed counter-press, which cuts off the pass forward and forces Atletico Madrid back.

The three players on the right are the key. The moment the ball is given back to Atletico Madrid, they spring into action.

There's no thinking; it all looks so well-drilled that it's muscle memory. As a unit, they advance; there's no second-guessing, there's no waiting.

It's easy to get the curved runs and the shadow covering to block off the pass wrong, leaving a space free for a pass forward, but every player involved is on it. There are no mistakes.

Girona places the bait, and Atletico Madrid takes the bait. Unless they want to kick it long out of their end, they're trapped, forced to pass backward.

I love the anticipation from Savio to see the play develop before it happens and make the run as Iván Martin is pressing the ball carrier. Then once Martin is ready to shoot, he's there to get the rebound.

Like the goals from Valery Fernández and the winner by Iván Martin; the shooting technique from Savio is top. Side volley, at the ground, bounce underneath the keeper and into the net. Impossible for Oblak to stop that type of shot.
