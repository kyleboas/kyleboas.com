Kevin-Prince Boateng tells a story from one of his first few training sessions at AC Milan that demonstrates just how good a player Andrea Pirlo was, how good is vision was, and how he wanted his teammates to communicate.

> You know in England in training, "Come on, hey! Give me the ball, give me that, give me", so I come to practice and I'm saying "Hey! Pass me the ball!"
>  
> Pirlo after one week takes me to the side and gets one player who speaks English to translate. He said, "Tell him to not shout." Oh, I was like, what's he trying to tell me? 
>  
> Because he said, "If you shouts, even the opponent knows he's free." He said, "if he's free, tell him, I will see him." 

The answer is, don't speak, communicate with your movement in silence. That is how a world-class creator thinks. "I will see him" is an iconic statement.
