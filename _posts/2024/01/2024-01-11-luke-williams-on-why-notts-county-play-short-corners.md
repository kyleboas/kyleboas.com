> I'm going to tell you the truth now. We have the most shots on target from corners in the EFL. One in four corners results in a shot on target, the best by a long way. We've scored the most goals in the division from corners, but you don't know that from corners, do you? Because unless we whack it in the box, it's not a corner. 
>  
> We take a corner, pass the ball, until the ball is turned over or goes off the pitch, it's still a corner. We are extremely successful at corners. I'm sorry to break your hearts; it's the truth because I made sure we did the research. 
>  
> I'm being serious now. Corners have a very low success rate across football, worldwide. Putting the ball into the box‚Äîyou know, when someone runs through the crowd, heads the ball, and it smashes into the net, we remember it. We don't remember fifty corners that just got caught by the goalkeeper, hit the side netting, or headed away; we forget. We also forget that when the ball comes into play immediately and is passed five times and then crossed from the other side, we think it was from open play. It was just a part of the game, but it wasn't; it was from a corner. 
>  
> When you play against Notts County, the ball is in play longer than any other game in the EFL. The players sprint...he sprints, gets the ball, puts it down, passes it immediately. So you don't get a break. 
>  
> Some defenders love corners for a rest. They're 6ft 3in; they don't want [Daniel Crowley] running at them or [Macaulay Langstaff] in the box free and scoring 42 goals *from open play*. So we take the ball, put it down, immediately pass the ball, and the defender says, "Ah, again Notts County, c'mon just kick it into the goalkeeper's hands, so we can smash the length of the pitch and break." No. Not gonna happen, I'm afraid. 
>  
> We kicked one last season directly into the box, and [Macaulay Langstaff] scored. You know why? Because everyone was at the corner trying to stop us from playing short. So I'm sorry to break everyone's hearts, but this is the reality; we are extremely successful from corners.

Nancy Froston of The Athletic wrote [an in-depth article](https://theathletic.com/5104900/2023/12/06/notts-county-short-corners-analysis/) fact-checking the claims made in his comments.

Would you rather build a team that can win every aerial duel from a corner or play it short and work it into a place on the pitch where you know you have a better chance of getting a high-quality shot off? 

I'd want the team that plays short corners because there are far fewer players that can win aerial duels and consistently do the other necessary things like dribbling, passing, and scoring from open play. 

I subscribe to Luke Williams' way of thinking. He [recently joined Swansea City](https://www.swanseacity.com/news/luke-williams-joins-swansea-city-head-coach). One to watch.
