Guilherme Ramos for Trivela (translated from Portuguese):

> In the pyramid, the three in front of them were the  half-backs. The term has been lost over the years and has no literal translation [to Portuguese], but in today's context, they could be considered midfielders. However, it was they who dropped back and became full-backs over the years, and this movement led to the  full-backs  opening up to the sides of the field.

Right? What the hell happened to half-backs?

We're so stuck trying to label  positions and then we're locked into this verbiage of roles that sometimes the name for the role doesn't fit the actual role.
