The Athletic:

> Several such sources said players were upset to find they now had little freedom to express their qualities on the pitch, contrasting Alonso’s more demanding and rigid approach to the team’s style with how things were under Ancelotti.
> 
> “Some of them have won so much without doing these things that when these have been imposed on them, they have complained," one of the sources said. “It’s no secret, some cases have been public. It’s normal, especially with those who were untouchable."
> 
> Another person close to a first-team player said Madrid had “gone from having a coach who was hardly involved in training sessions to one who seems like just another player".
> 
> And further sources consulted for this article said the players’ impression of Alonso was that he was distant and unapproachable — again contrasting with Ancelotti, who was very popular with the group.

It's a visible frustration that you can see on the pitch. They aren't hiding their frustration. It is an example of winning but not enjoying the football it takes to win.
