title: "Three rule changes the Premier League should consider to nerf corners and throw-ins"
---

I don't want to watch teams play to win corners and throw-ins and then take their sweet old time taking said corners and throw-ins. I want the ball in play. I don't want to see players descend into the box to wrestle.

1. Once the throw in taker touches the ball, they have 8 seconds to take the throw. Any undue delay will be met with a yellow card.
2. No more using any part of your arms to push an opponent inside the box during a corner kick.

Bonus rule that is controversial but could make corners entertaining for people who hate corners, like me.

3. To mimic a cross, limit the number of players inside the box during a corner to three attackers and four defenders, with the rest of the players outside the box. 

The league should want the ball in play. They're going to have to do something because [corners kick are too overpowered](https://tacticsjournal.com/2025/10/12/corner-kicks-are-overpowered/).
