Pau Cubarsí on what makes learning in La Masia so special:

> All the coaches focus a lot on teaching the small details, showing you the big difference they make in our game. For me, hiding my passes a bit more was very important, because in the end the opponent is always monitoring where and how you pass the ball. It’s all about not giving information away, while doing the right things.
> 
> You try to hide it with the body shape, not looking too much where you want to pass it. It gives your team-mate more time to do his part, and becomes a chain reaction that impacts the whole team.
> 
> I would stay beyond training to try and improve what my managers told me. I knew these were the details that would allow me to make it into the football elite. Small details that might be imperceptible to many, but at the top level this is what makes you stay or not. I have to thank all my managers for that.

Finding the least obvious pass is [in their blood](https://tacticsjournal.com/2025/06/29/busquets-led-with-his-chest/).
