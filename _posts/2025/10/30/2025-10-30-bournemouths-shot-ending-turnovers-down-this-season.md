David Segar for Opta Analyst:

> Most notably, Bournemouth have been the most active pressers in the Premier League for a while now. Passes per defensive action (PPDA) is the number of opposition passes allowed outside of the pressing team’s own defensive third, divided by the number of defensive actions by the pressing team outside of their own defensive third. A lower figure indicates a higher level of pressing intensity (defensive actions are fouls, tackles, interceptions, challenges, and blocked passes).
> 
> Bournemouth had the lowest PPDA in the Premier League last season (9.9), and after nine matchdays, also have the lowest this term (9.8).
> 
> It isn’t much of a surprise therefore to see that they are effective when it comes to high turnovers – possessions that start in open play and begin 40 metres or less from the opponent’s goal. Bournemouth made the second most in the Premier League last season (337) and had the most shot-ending high turnovers (68). This season, they are second again for high turnovers (71) and fourth for shot-ending ones (14), but that slight drop might be a result of teams trying something new to combat it.

While watching it feels like there's more spray and pray passing with Senesi and Diakite versus Zabaryni and Huijsen.
