Paul MacInnes for The Guardian:

> The International Football Association Board (Ifab) has discussed the possibility of limiting how long a player can spend on a throw-in, in a bid to increase the amount of time the ball is in play during a match.
> 
> [...] According to Stats Perform, there were more than twice as many long throws in the Premier League in the opening weeks of this season, compared with last season as a whole, with an average of 3.44 per match compared with 1.52 in 2024-25. In the first 40 games of the season there was also a significant drop-off in in-play time, at 54 minutes and 21 seconds per match that is 133sec lower than last season.

Short and long throw-ins should take the same amount of time. The goal should be to force the ball to be in play.
