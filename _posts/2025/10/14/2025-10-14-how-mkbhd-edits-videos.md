Although it is a different medium—video—there are ways to take those same editing concepts that MKBHD and his team use and apply them to writing.

I'm someone who likes to write without thinking. Write like I talk. I only make edits for grammar and punctuation. That makes the process faster and eventually your mind will force you to write better over time.

Cutting things out is something I do to help steer momentum though.
