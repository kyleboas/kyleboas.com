Roberto Parrottino (translated to English):

> From the beginning of the 21st century, if African talent does not emigrate to Europe, Europe colonizes and extracts talent from Africa through "academies" and agreements with local clubs. From the powerful Paris Saint-Germain (France) in Senegal, Rwanda and Morocco, Bayern Munich (Germany) in Rwanda, and Manchester City (England) in Egypt, to the lesser known MŠK Žilina (Slovakia) and Nordsjaelland (Denmark) in Ghana. In parallel, complaints of scams, exploitation, child trafficking and falsification of ages in documents. Stories of boys abandoned on the streets of European cities after injuries or truncated in tests.

Someone has to speak for those that are brought in and then spit out by the system in such a cruel manner.
