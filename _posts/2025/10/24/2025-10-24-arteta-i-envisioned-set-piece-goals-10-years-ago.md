James Olley for ESPN:

> Asked when he realised set-pieces would be such a pivotal part of his approach, Arteta said: "Ten years ago. I wasn't here but 10 years ago, I said 'it is a massive thing to do that' and I started to have a vision, try to implement a method and try to be surrounded by the best people to deliver that."
> 
> Arteta was undertaking his coaching badges during the 2015-16 season, his final season as a player at Arsenal, before joining City where he met Nicolas Jover, who would later become set-piece coach at Brentford before joining Arsenal in 2021, less than two years after Arteta became manager.

It is the biggest advantage in football because you must sign a good corner kick taker and have the right profiles attacking the cross. That is not something a team can adjust to, it is a premeditated recruitment shift.
