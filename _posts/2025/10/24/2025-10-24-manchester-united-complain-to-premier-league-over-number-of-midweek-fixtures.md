The Athletic:

> In the 12 weeks between October 5 and December 25, United will play only one home match on a weekend â€” against Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday.
> 
> During that period, United have three consecutive midweek home fixtures, with the games against Everton in November and Bournemouth in December having been rescheduled for Monday evenings. The West Ham United match in the first week of December was always set for midweek.
> 
> Away from home, United fans are faced with a 12.30pm (GMT, 7.30am ET) kick-off at Tottenham Hotspur on November 8, a 12pm Sunday kick-off at Crystal Palace on November 30 and an 8pm kick-off at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Monday, December 8.
> 
> The date for the festive home fixture with Newcastle United has yet to be confirmed by the Premier League but is likely to fall on Boxing Day, a Friday, with an 8pm kick-off.

Tough life for one of the world's most popular teams when you don't qualify for Europe.
