Water should be free and this is an incredible concept for a real problem. 

This company, FreeWater, packages water in a carton and sells it free to the consumer. Each carton of water is paid for by ads that are put on the carton by third-party advertisers. They also sell aluminum bottles but no plastic bottle, and they have a long term goal to "distribute all our beverages in glass bottles 100% hemp cartons." 

They are boasting that advertisers get 10x more impressions compared to direct email, $2.50 cheaper per ten impressions than direct mail, and 29% return on investment.

They donate ten cents per beverage to WellAware, an Austin based non-profit that builds water wells in East Africa.
