Colin Millar for The Athletic:

> However, there is an important caveat: Romania are in San Marino’s qualification group, and are currently third, behind second-placed Bosnia & Herzegovina and first-placed Austria. Romania play away to Bosnia on November 15, before hosting San Marino on the final matchday, and whether Romania beats Bosnia to a top-two finish — with Austria looking likely to keep first place — is likely to be decided by goal difference.
> 
> In this scenario, San Marino’s best interests would be served not only by losing to Romania but by losing by as many goals as possible to ensure Romania secure a top-two finish at the expense of Bosnia and therefore create a play-off opening for itself. After hosting Romania, Bosnia faces first-placed Austria in its final qualification match on November 18, when San Marino plays Romania. Austria, meanwhile, face fourth-placed Cyprus on November 15 before its game against Bosnia.
> 
> If Bosnia gets favourable results against Romania and/or Austria, San Marino’s slim chances of World Cup qualification will dwindle.
> 
> San Marino will also hope that Czechia, Sweden and Northern Ireland maintain a top-two group finish to boost its own hopes. North Macedonia and Wales are in the same group, so one will miss out on a play-off spot, while Moldova has lost all five group matches and therefore cannot mathematically qualify through its group.
> 
> San Marino can therefore only make a play-off spot if one or fewer of Romania, Czechia, Sweden and Northern Ireland miss out on a top-two finish in their groups.

San Marino are one of the few teams I follow closely each international break because it's a tremendous story. A country surrounded by Italy, the fifth-smallest country in the world, with a population of 34,000 people could qualify for the World Cup. Before the goal was to score, and they had trouble scoring so losing heavily shouldn't be difficult.
