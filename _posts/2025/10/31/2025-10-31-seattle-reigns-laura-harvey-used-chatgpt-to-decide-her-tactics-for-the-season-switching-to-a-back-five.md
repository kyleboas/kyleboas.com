Seattle Reign manager Laura Harvey speaking to the Soccerish Podcast:

> “One day in the offseason, I was writing things into ChatGPT like, ‘What is Seattle Reign’s identity?’ And it would spurt it out. And I was like ‘I don’t know if that’s true or not,'" Harvey told the Soccerish Podcast.
> 
> “And then I put in, ‘What formation should you play to beat NWSL teams?’ And it spurted out every team in the league and what formation you should play. And for two teams, it went ‘You should play a back five.’ So I did. No joke, that’s why I did it."

You could not waterboard this information out of me.
