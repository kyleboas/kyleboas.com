This is the future of sports, not just the NFL. With artificial intelligence we should be able to get live action analysis to tell us what is happening, even before it happens. It should be something that you can toggle on and off, but it is nice that there's an option for those who don't know what to look for. And even for those that know what to look for, if you're watching casually the visual aids will help.
