One of the only things I look forward to every international break is the England national team's training videos. [The latest one](https://youtu.be/-YOoJbx38tA?si=oIpi1AZ9fTjemiiX) does not disappoint. They are damn clinical and sharp as a razor.

I'd watch 90 minutes of them training over a 90 minute game. That Wales game was a sleeper.
