[Nick Ames for The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/09/gianni-infantino-moving-world-cup-club-world-cup):

> Discussions are under way about the calendar for the period after 2030, which is a particular point of tension given the increased squeeze being applied by expanded competitions. Fifa has set up a working group to examine the issue, and the global governing body has given itself a headache by awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia. That tournament will almost certainly be staged in winter, as Qatar 2022 was. Infantino suggested the sport should get used to untying itself from the European summer.

> "We are already into the nitty-gritty, we are discussing all the time," he said. "It’s not just about one World Cup, it’s a general reflection. Even to play in some European countries in July it is very, very hot. The best month to play football, which is June, is not used very much in Europe.

> "Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar, but we are discussing it and we will see when we come to some conclusions. We just have to keep an open mind."

I'm open to Winter World Cups too but not for the reason Infantino favors them. 

Think of it from a player welfare perspective. If they play in the winter, the leagues can't play simultaneously. That cuts down on business for domestic leagues, the Champions League, and Europa League, but there's a chance players might get more of a break during the summer. 

Summer World Cups offer zero breaks for the players. They play year round with no true breaks.
