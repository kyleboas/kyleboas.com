t1: "Exclusive: Mancini rivals Dyche for Forest job after Postecoglou’s sacking"

The Telegraph:

> Roberto Mancini has emerged as a rival to front-runner Sean Dyche to replace Ange Postecoglou following the Australian’s sacking at Nottingham Forest after just 39 days in charge.
> 
> Contact has been made with Mancini, the former Manchester City manager, who is out of work and is understood to be interested in taking over at the City Ground. As revealed by Telegraph Sport last Saturday, talks have already taken place with Dyche, who is also available.
> 
> Fulham’s Marco Silva is also of interest, although a high compensation figure of at least £7m may put him out of reach and no formal approach has been made. Even so, the Portuguese has grown frustrated at Fulham, where he is in the final year of his contract, and is expected to leave at the end of this campaign and would like to stay in the Premier League. Silva also worked under Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis at the Greek club Olympiacos, where he won the league title.

I find it hard to believe that a club like Nottingham Forest, that has spent over €672.38m since 2022 on transfers in, is detered by a £7m compensation figure to sign Marco Silva.
