Jordan Campbell for The Athletic with words from former Manchester City assistant Carlos Vicens, who focused on set-pieces:

> City had signals to denote which routine was to be used. One hand, two hands, no hands. Vicens found that doing between 10 and 15 minutes of work on refreshing which specific routines he had selected for the upcoming opponent was enough. The signals helped simplify things. It was necessary because when the ball went out of play for a corner in games, Guardiola would call players over, or they would use that time to discuss tactical issues among themselves. [...]
> 
> “I did not want to be someone in a lab who would only be around them on the grass for 10 minutes. I was on the grass daily, interacting with them, implementing the exercises, talking to the players about open-play football, too. It shortens the time you need to get to know them.
> 
> “It was good, as sometimes as an assistant to Pep, you will do a lot of things, but almost never direct yourself to the players. That got me training for moments as a head coach. On the grass and at the auditorium, for 10 minutes, I was the head coach."
> 
> It prepared him for making the step to become a manager. He had the opportunity to join Heracles in 2022, but decided to stay at City after the Dutch side were relegated.

I find that interesting that Pep's assistants "almost never direct" themselves to the players.
