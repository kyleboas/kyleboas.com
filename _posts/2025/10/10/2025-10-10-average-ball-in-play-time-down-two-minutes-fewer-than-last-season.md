David Segar for Opta Analyst:

> We have seen an average ball-in-play time of 55 minutes exactly per game this season after 70 matches, almost two full minutes fewer than last season (56 mins, 59 secs) and over three minutes fewer than 2023-24 (58 mins, 11 secs).
> 
> You might think it just means added time isn’t as long as it was the last two seasons, but at the moment the overall length of games including stoppage time (100 mins, 35 secs) is second only to the 2023-24 campaign (101 mins, 36 secs) in Premier League history on record (since 2006-07). Games are lasting on average 51 seconds longer than last season (99 mins, 44 secs), even though, as mentioned, the ball is in play for almost two minutes fewer.
> 
> That means, on average, each game this season has no ball in play for a total of two minutes and 50 seconds longer than last season, roughly the time it would take to listen to You’re the One That I Want by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.
> 
> In total, games are averaging 45 minutes and 35 seconds of delays/pauses during play this season (up from 42 minutes and 45 seconds last season), or roughly one episode of Countdown. We could all be struggling to solve a conundrum instead of watching someone saunter over slowly to take a corner in stoppage time.
> 
> For clarity, our definition of a ‘delay’ is the time between the ball going out of play and play resuming across corners, free kicks, throw-ins, goal kicks, kick-offs, penalties and drop balls.
> 
> In terms of overall ball-in-play time across full seasons since 2010-11, it has only been lower than 55 minutes twice, clocking an average of 54 minutes and 45 seconds in 2021-22 and just four seconds longer in 2022-23.

Teams are playing for set-pieces, a trend I hate, and hate is a strong word.

> Compared to last season, teams are generally spending more time in taking corners, goal-kicks and throw-ins. For the latter, it is understandable considering how many more long throws we’re seeing. It’s actually fairly surprising throw-ins are only taking just over two seconds longer on average, up to 17.7 seconds this season from 15.6 seconds in 2024-25.
> 
> Goal-kicks are also taking two seconds longer (30.3 seconds, up from 28.3 seconds) on average, but corners have seen the most noticeable jump, up to 36.9 seconds from 33.6 seconds last season. With each one taking 3.3 seconds longer on average, if we end up seeing the same number of corners in the Premier League as last season (3,890), we will have spent more than three and a half hours extra waiting for them in total across the campaign.

As a football community we will have to decide if playing for set-pieces is the direction we would like to see the Premier League move towards. If we don't want it to go into that direction, new rules should be put in place to penalize teams who are afraid of scoring from open play.

Scoring from open play will always be more exciting than dunking in a header or tipping in a bumbled ball from a corner.
