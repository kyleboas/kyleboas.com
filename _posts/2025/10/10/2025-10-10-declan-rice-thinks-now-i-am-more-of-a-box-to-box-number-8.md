Declan Rice:

> “I can play No6 or No8," said Rice. “I think now I am more of a box-to-box number 8.
> 
> “The manager has adjusted my position at Arsenal a bit this year, given me a bit more freedom to drop deep but also get in the box when I can.
> 
> “It is the same with Thomas. I think that really suits me on that left side of midfield. Being able to get back, being an all-round action midfielder is what I want to be and I am just enjoying my football.
> 
> “I have got two managers who lay it out really easy with the game plan, what I have to do and where I have to be.

Declan Rice would be the best ball playing center-back in the world if he played there regularly. Other people say he is the best midfielder in the Premier League. He has always had more to offer and will be make a bigger impact in other positions other than being limited to playing as a 6.
