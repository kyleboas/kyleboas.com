Andreas Georgson has an interesting coaching history within a short span of time from 2019 till today. He’s served as a set-piece coach under Thomas Frank at Brentford, Mikel Arteta at Arsenal, Russell Martin at Southampton, and Erik ten Hag at Manchester United, before stepping into management himself with a caretaker stint at Malmö and later a permanent role at Lillestrøm. He is now back with Thomas Frank at Tottenham.

The AMA is Tuesday, October 14th, at 4:30 PM UK time but you can ask questions now.
