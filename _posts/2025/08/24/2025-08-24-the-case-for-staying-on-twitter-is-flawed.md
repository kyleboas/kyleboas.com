Jerusalem Demsas: 

> For a hot second, it seemed like if enough people migrated to a Twitter clone, the old site would collapse and we could all build a new Nazi-free platform. Like many, I joined Threads and Mastodon and Bluesky, filled with hope that entire networks could reform on a new platform. But Mastodon was clunky, Meta banned news and politics, and Bluesky turned into a boring progressive echo chamber (unsurprisingly, usage is falling off).

That is a good way of putting it. I don't want to participate. 

The goal of changing platforms is not to reform the old platform or attempt to kill it, it is to make a new one with people you know to continue to communicate with them.

If Hitler's friend bought LinkedIn back in the day and made it a Nazi heaven, you're not morally correct for staying posting for job openings on LinkedIn.

If you stay posting on X you either don't care or you are a professional who relies on people clicking on your posts to maintain a job. I feel bad for the professionals because that is their livelihood, but I don't feel bad for the people who don't care.

I'd rather slowly build a following through word of mouth than feel like a piece of garbage.
