Ali Tweedle for Opta Analyst:

> Yoane Wissa’s goal against Manchester City on Tuesday night took him clear as the leading scorer in Brentford’s Premier League history.
> 
> The DR Congo forward now has 37 Premier League goals for the club, moving one clear of Ivan Toney who departed in the summer having scored 36 times for the west London club. [...]
> 
> Wissa’s 37 Brentford goals have come from almost nine hours less game time than Toney, 60 fewer shots, and a much lower expected goals total. Wissa has also never taken a penalty for the club, while 11 of Toney’s 36 goals came from the spot.
> 
> Wissa has outscored his xG (29.2) by more than seven, while Toney’s 36 goals came from almost exactly that number of expected goals (36.1). Take penalties out of the equation, though, and Toney scored 25 goals from 26.7 xG. [...]
> 
> Of players with at least 1,000 minutes played this season, Wissa ranks third for non-penalty goals per 90 (0.71), behind only Isak (0.8) and Haaland (0.72), and fourth for non-penalty xG per 90 (0.64).
> 
> He also doesn’t have as many shots as many of the other best strikers in the league, in part because he plays for Brentford. Wissa has had 42 shots this season, putting him 19th in the Premier League for total shots. His tally is less than half Haaland’s total (85).

Yoane Wissa is the most underrated striker in the Premier League, might be the most underrated player, period. I think it is due to his height but that shouldn't be a determining factor when you can offer this output. And he is only 28 years old.
