Freddie Pye for City Xtra:

> Speaking to [Spanish newspaper AS](https://as.com/), Sergio Gomez spoke of his own City exit for Real Sociedad last summer, insisting that improved on-field opportunities became the driving force behind the decision to leave one of the game’s leading clubs.
> 
> "You are practically in the best club in the world, and although you know that it can be difficult to play, you see that you have possibilities, and you feel like trying," Gómez explained, as [translated and relayed by Sport Witness](https://sportwitness.co.uk/player-says-manchester-city-exit-came-at-right-time-encourages-teammate-to-snub-pep-guardiolas-side/).
> 
> "But you want minutes and that’s why Real’s interest came at the right time. Then the Games also helped me gain confidence and the start with Real was also good, to the point that thanks to it they called me up to the national team."
> 
> Gomez is currently starring alongside Martin Zubimendi in the existing Real Sociedad squad and Manchester City have consistently been linked with the Spain star over the last few months.
> 
> However, on the subject of Zubimendi’s future in the game, Sergio Gomez said, “He’s much better at Real Sociedad than at Manchester City. I’ve already told you, it’s not that big of a deal."

I don't normally care about comments like this, but these ones have legs. This younger players in the lower tier and world-class players in the higher tier. Those players that are in the middle tier are a question mark for minutes. 

Martin Zubimendi is a better player than Sergio Gomez, but for players in that middle tier, I can see why you wouldn't want to join Manchester City. The minutes aren't very good because they rotate like a responsible club, not like the irresponsible ones who throw out the same starting eleven every week and then wonder why they have an injury crisis.
