title: "Own your work"
---

My hope with the upheaval over a general lack of moderation and an embrace of AI by social media companies drives people to make their own homes on the internet.

For them to realize that if they care about their work, they should make their own website, and host their own blog on the own domain they own. Own your words and then link to it.

It might seem daunting to start but it's a better way to connect.
