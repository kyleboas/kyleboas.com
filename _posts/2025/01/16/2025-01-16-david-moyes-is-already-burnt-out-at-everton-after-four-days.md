David Moyes after Everton's 1-0 loss to Aston Villa: 

> I thought the crowd were great and I was really thankful for my reception but I am keeping my head down because I don't want to be at a team near the bottom of the league and I have lost.
> 
> At the moment I have to find a way for the team to get a result. I've only been here a couple of days and I'm nearly burnt out looking at how we can score more goals and how we can get players who can do that.
> 
> With the squad we have, everybody is saying 'How are you going to find that?'
> 
> If we get someone different that's OK but we have to find ways within the squad, we have to make goals, score goals and improve our attacking play.
> 
> They are not there trying not to play well. Maybe they are just needing someone to give them a lift and a little bit of quality to make the difference and we are just lacking that at the moment.

It is commendable that Moyes would want to come back to help right the ship and a club that helped propel his career, but this is thankless job and you'd have to assume they don't have the funds.
