Mark Brus for CaughtOffside:

> CaughtOffside understands that Nunez has been told very clearly that he needs to be more consistent and contribute more to this Liverpool team, and sources indicate that the player has taken that on board and vowed to put in the work required.

> However, it is also felt that Liverpool would now consider offers in the region of Â£50-60m to let the Uruguay international go, and there is some interest emerging.
