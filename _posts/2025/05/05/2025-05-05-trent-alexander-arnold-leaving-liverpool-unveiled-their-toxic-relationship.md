Jamie Carragher:

The point then, as it is today, is once you are a mainstay at a club of Liverpool’s stature you are already at the summit of the game. As a Scouser, for me it does not get any bigger or better.

I never like to encroach upon a club's fanbase that is not my own, but it has to be said that a player should be allowed to leave a club for another club in another league.

I understand that it could be seen as a betrayal if the player is moving to a rival team within the Premier League, but players should be allowed to explore. 

I'm glad my club has not created that kind of atmosphere where players feel like they have to stay forever.
