Then he realised he could use the wall and ceiling as references; at any instant the fly’s position could be logged against a horizontal and vertical axis. Enlightenment! X and Y. Grid logic. Modern thinking. Full steam ahead!

Patterns appeared, symbols were assigned to represent them. 3–2–2–3 becomes WM. A scattering of stars becomes Ursa Major.
