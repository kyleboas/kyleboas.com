## Analytics

I use third party analytics software from [Clicky](https://clicky.com/terms/privacy) and [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy). I use it to see what people are reading and how they are using my site. You can view their Privacy Policy to see what information is collected.

## Sponsors

I have several sponsors for which I share links in posts, pages, and banner ads promoting their products or services. I will make it clear with a disclaimer that the link is sponsored.

Some sponsored links may use cookies. The cookies are used to track if you make a purchase of a product or service on the website that I have referred you to. If you make a purchase on the website I linked to, after clicking on the link I shared, before the cookies expire, I will earn a commission. The expiration of the cookies varies depending on the sponsor; it can be anywhere up to 90 days.

Please read the privacy policy of the website I have referred you to learn more about their cookie policy.

## Sharing with third parties 

No information is shared with third parties, including sponsors and affiliates.
