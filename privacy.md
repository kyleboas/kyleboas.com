## Analytics

The following information is collected to help me get a better understanding of what visitors are reading:

- URL of the visited page.
- Referrer (Twitter, Facebook, Google, or any other third-party website).

I use a cookie-free analytics service called GoatCounter. You can [view their Privacy Policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy).

> No personal information (such as IP address) is collected; a hash of the IP address, User-Agent, and a random number (“salt”) is kept in the process memory for 8 hours to identify a browsing session, and is never stored to disk.
> 
> There is no information stored in the browser with cookies, localStorage, or other methods. 

If you would like to opt out of being tracked, you would have to stop visiting this website.

## Sponsors

I have several sponsors for which I share links in posts, pages, and banner ads promoting their products or services. I will make it clear with a disclaimer that the link is sponsored.

Some sponsored links may use "cookies". The cookies are used to track if you make a purchase of a product or service on the website that I have referred you to. If you make a purchase on the website linked to, after clicking on the link I shared, before the cookie expires, I will earn a commission. The expiration of the cookie varies depending on the sponsor; it can be anywhere up to 90 days.

Please read the privacy policy of the website I have referred you to learn more about their cookie policy.

## Sharing with third parties 

No information is shared with third parties, including sponsors and affiliates.
