## Analytics 

The following information is collected to help me get a better understanding of what visitors are reading:

I use an analytics software called GoatCounter. You can [view their Privacy Policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy). 

> No personal information (such as IP address) is collected; a hash of the IP address, User-Agent, and a random number (“salt”) is kept in the process memory for 8 hours to identify a browsing session, and is never stored to disk. 

> There is no information stored in the browser with cookies, localStorage, or other methods. 

If you would like to opt out of being tracked, you would have to stop visiting this website. 

## Sponsors

I have several sponsors and affiliates for which I share links in posts, pages, and banner ads promoting their products or services. I will make it clear with a disclaimer that the link is sponsored. 

Each sponsored link contains a cookie. The cookie is used to track if you make a purchase of a product or service on the website that I have referred you to. 

The expiration of the cookie varies depending on the sponsor; it can be anywhere up to 60 days. If you make a purchase on the website linked, after clicking on the link I shared, before the cookie expires, I will earn a commission.

Please read the privacy policy of the website I have referred you to if you have any questions regarding how they use those cookies. 

## Sharing with third parties 

No information is shared with third parties, including sponsors and affiliates.
