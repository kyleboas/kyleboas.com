Hello, my name is Kyle Boas. I am the author of the [Tactics Journal](https://tacticsjournal.com), a blog where I share thoughts about football from across the globe but focusing primarily on teams in Europe. The tagline is "Analyzing football tactics."

I've always wanted a link blog, this is where I will be sharing what I am reading or watching. Some things will not be football related.

If you have any suggestions of things to read or watch, please send them to me at <a href="mailto:kyle@tacticsjournal.com">kyle@tacticsjournal.com</a>.
