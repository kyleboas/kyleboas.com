Hello, my name is Kyle Boas. I am the author of the Tactics Journal, a blog where I share thoughts about football from across the globe but focusing primarily on teams in Europe. The tagline is "Analyzing football tactics." 

I've always wanted a link blog, this is where I will be sharing what I am reading or watching. Some things will not be football related.

If you have any suggestions please send them to me at kyle@tacticsjournal.com.
